# This is IÅ¡mOK tutorials

In the past, I learned that some Lithuanian schools still use Pascal to prepare students for the 12th-grade final IT exam. Since the IT subject wasn't challenging for me (I scored 100% on the exam), I decided to create a modern resource where Lithuanian high school students could teach themselves C++ to prepare for the IT exam.
